          <h3>Cost Savings</h3>
          <p>
            Big hosting providers have expensive support departments for people who don't know how to use their services. This costs money. Why pay extra for support you don't need? We cut the support team and pass the savings on to you - to the tune of 20% off pricing
            at larger providers.

          <h3>No Nonsense</h3>
          <p>
            We strive to provide a no nonsense hosting platform. If our stuff breaks we will tell you why it broke and what we have actually done to fix it. No mysterious resolution messages here.

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h3 class="faq">No support? What if I have a billing problem, or if there are infrastructure problems?</h3>
      <p class="faq">Fear not, we will always support our platform. If you suspect there is a problem on our end you are welcome to <a href="mailto:wtf@bitkumo.com">email</a> us with the relevant information.</p>
      <h3 class="faq">Why don't you offer support?</h3>
      <p class="faq">It is expensive to provide good support to customers. To provide support, most providers bake extra cost into their plan prices making everybody pay more for their services. Not everybody needs support though, so if you are a capable systems administrator
        you pay to subsidize the support for people who have no idea how to configure their system, need help with Apache or other system administration related questions. We decided that isn't right. If you don't need support you shouldn't have to pay
        for it, so we got rid of the support team and made our prices 20% cheaper than bigger competitors.</p>
      <h3 class="faq">What if I need support for administrative tasks?</h3>
      <p class="faq">Honestly your best resource is Google. If you want to know how to setup Apache search "How do I set up Apache?" in Google. If you need more help than that you might want to consult sites like <a href="http://serverfault.com/">ServerFault</a> or
        a forum related to the problem you are having.</p>
      <h3 class="faq">What technology do you use?</h3>
      <p class="faq">Our hypervisors use QEMU/KVM for virtualization and our panel is provided by <a href="https://virtkick.com">Virtkick</a>.</p>
      <h3 class="faq">Can you guys add {feature}?</h3>
      <p class="faq">We'll do our best! Email us some details of what you need and we'll see if we can make it happen, no promises though!</p>
